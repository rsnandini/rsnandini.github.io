This project was conducted at UGC- DAE Consortium for Scientific Research, Indore, India, as a master's dissertation. The master's project entitled 'Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopic studies of LaFeO<sub>3</sub> and LaMnO<sub>3</sub> across magnetic order,' this project marked my entry into materials science. I synthesized LaFeO<sub>3</sub> and LaMnO<sub>3</sub> using the solid-state reaction method, and for the first time, I was able to determine the crystal structure of the powdered sample using X-ray diffraction. This project, which involved both low and high-temperature Raman spectroscopy to observe the presence of the spin-phonon coupling, allowed me to explore my interests in a novel way.
