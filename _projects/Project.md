This project was performed at the School of PhysicsDevi Ahilya Vishwa Vidyalaya, Indore, India, funded by the Inter-University Accelerator Center, New Delhi, India. This research project entitled “Effect of swift heavy ion irradiation (SHI) on structural and magnetic properties of nanocrystalline spinel ferrites” exposed me to attend various workshops and conferences and present my work at different stages in India. In this project, I have synthesized the various spinel ferrites and analyzed the structural, surface morphological, elemental confirmation, and magnetic data. While working on this project, I published a conference proceeding, which helped me understand the art of publication writing and inculcate the scientific temperament in me. This project enhanced my interest in magnetism, the basis of the various magnetic memory components.

<!--Large datasets have enabled over-parameterized neural networks to achieve unprecedented success. However, training such models, with millions or billions of parameters, on large data requires expensive computational resources, which consume substantial energy, leave a massive amount of carbon footprint, and often soon become obsolete and turn into e-waste. While there has been a persistent effort to improve the performance and reliability of machine learning models, their sustainability is often neglected.

To address the sustainability and efficiency of machine learning, one approach involves selecting the most relevant data for training. We address the above problem by proposing rigorous methods to find coresets for training machine learning models, in particular neural networks. 
 We address this problem both in supervised settings, as well as unsupervised setting for pretraining large models on large datasets. -->
