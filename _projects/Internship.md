<!-- Spurious correlations that degrade model generalization or lead the model to be right for the wrong reasons are one of the main robustness concerns for real-world deployments.  -->

I have worked as a summer intern at the <b>Institute for Plasma research, Gandhinagar, India</b>, where I delved into the plasma diagnostics division. This experience, which entailed measuring temperature and plasma density in the SST-1 Tokamak using laser-based Thomson scattering, was my initial direct exposure to the research environment. The project,' Calibration of polychromator for Thomson scattering using Raman scattering,' equipped me with the skills to design experiments, calibrate bandpass filters and detectors, and record final gains.
