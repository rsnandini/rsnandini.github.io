I am a Postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.howard.edu/) at [Howard University](https://howard.edu/), where I work in the [Quantum Materials Modeling Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/sugatachowdhury/home).


I am a physicist specializing in Materials Science and Technology, with a focus on the synthesis and characterization of magnetic materials for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. My research aims to enhance computational efficiency by reducing current dissipation and enabling more compact memory storage solutions. Through my work, I strive to advance the development of innovative materials that can significantly impact the future of computing technologies.

<!--My research aims to address [sustainability, reliability, and efficiency](https://baharanm.github.io/projects/) of machine learning. I am mainly working on improving the <b>big data quality</b>, by developing theoretically rigorous methods to select the most beneficial data for [efficient](projects/#efficiency) and [robust](projects/#robustness) learning. Besides, I am also interested in improving the models and learning algorithms. The resulting methods are broadly applicable for learning from massive datasets across a wide range of applications, such as medical diagnosis and environment sensing.-->

<!-- My research focuses on developing new methods that enable efficient machine learning from massive datasets. More specifically, I am interested in designing techniques that can gain insights from the underlying data structure by utilizing complex and higher-order interactions between data points. The extracted information can be used to efficiently explore and robustly learn from datasets that are too large to be dealt with by traditional approaches. My methods have immediate application to high-impact problems where massive data volumes prohibit efficient learning and inference, such as huge image collections, recommender systems, Web and social services, video and other large data streams. -->


<!--Before joining UCLA, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) working with [Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) advised by [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea/). I received an [ETH medal for Outstanding Doctoral Thesis](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/main/eth-zurich/education/auszeichnungen-preise/files/eth-medaille/medaille-doktorarbeit-2017.pdf), was selected as a [Rising Star in EECS by MIT](https://risingstars18-eecs.mit.edu/participant-mirzasoleiman/), and received an [NSF Career Award](https://samueli.ucla.edu/ucla-computer-scientist-receives-nsf-career-award-to-improve-sustainability-in-machine-learning/). <br /><br />-->


Prior to joining Howard University, I was a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Materials Science and Technology at the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU)]( https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/mst), where I worked under the guidance of [Dr. Shrawan Kumar Mishra]( https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/mst/people/shrawanmst). During my time at the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), I synthesized and characterized high-anisotropy iron garnets using a cost-effective, all-solution method. I was honored to be an INSPIRE fellow during this period and received the award for Best Poster Presentation at the 8th International Conference on Nanomaterials for Better Living (NBL 2023) in Srinagar, India. Additionally, I was awarded the Scholarship for Higher Education by INSPIRE, a program of the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, which supported my master’s and bachelor’s studies.<br /><br />
